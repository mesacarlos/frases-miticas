# Architecture
The application is divided into two parts:

- An API in the backend part to work with business logic and persistence.

- A web interface where the user can interact with the application by communicating with the API.

## Backend
The API follows a structure based on DDD (Domain-Driven Design). It is a software development methodology that emphasizes the importance of business domain and business logic in system architecture and design.
